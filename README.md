# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Calculated number of customers who would buy again. The percentage can then be calculated from this data which is more realistic. 

Annoyingly "case" is a reserved JS word

Remove unecessary consoles

Not always necessary to use the context API

Removed focus from buttons using blur() at the end of the function

Summary card differences:
bullet point section of mine is 1px shorter as border is part of box.
Could use an after element instead ...
Margin under button on mine is 2em (same as all other sides of the card), margin on design is 28px - would question. 

Spacing of select buttons - doesn't match but why is the spacing as it is? Making it match would be adding additional CSS, is this necessary? 

Mobile designed with 360px in mind

Design didn't have consistent spacing between the icon and the detail text - I have chosen to make it consistent

Initially tried to use .wine-details__item + .wine-details__item to give margin left of 1em but this caused a problem when I changed the wine-details to flex-wrap for the few cases where the details didn't fit on one line for some of the smaller cards. The initial way left an unwanted margin to the left of the item that wrapped. Used gap instead which is now very well supported (previous advise was to not use it).
